# Project 01 - TODO App

[![JavaScript Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-JavaScript-F4D03F.svg)](https://www.javascript.com/)

The full project specification can be found [here](https://cs50.github.io/mobile/projects/0).

## Requirements

The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating a TODO app. This app should be able to add tasks and track the number of **total tasks** as well as the number of **unchecked tasks**.

Inside of [index.html](/index.html), you'll find some starter HTML. You shouldn't need to edit this file at all. Open this file on your computer into any browser to run the project.
Make sure that [script.js](/script.js) and [styles.css](/styles.css) are in the same local directory.
With the file open in your browser, you should see a `New TODO` button, which `alert`s when clicked. **Your goal will be to get this button to create new tasks.**

Inside [styles.css](/styles.css), you'll find some pre-written CSS for your convenience.
You shouldn't need to edit this file at all, but **feel free to if desired.**

[script.js](/script.js) is where most of your work will be done. There is some starter code for you in the file.

- The `classNames` variable can be used to link any elements you create in JavaScript with the associated CSS class names.
- The next 3 lines of code are the HTML elements that you'll need to update when creating new
tasks.
- Lastly, you'll see the `addTodo()` function. This gets executed when creating a new task. You should **replace the `alert()` call with logic to create new tasks**.

Good luck!

###Challenge! (Not Required)

If you finish early and are up for a challenge, try adding delete functionality. This should be in the form of a button within each `TODO` that removes that `TODO` when clicked.
